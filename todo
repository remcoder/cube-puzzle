- improve bitstring representation for speed

generate all translational variants within 4x4x4
  - draw the shapes in 4x4x4 area

combine 2 shapes
count overlapping blocks

Cubism features that we need;
- combine 2 shapes into 1:
  Shape.Combine(shape2);
  Better than plotting 2 shapes ontop of each other b/c it will result in rendering glitches and degrades performance.
  So to plot both a puzzle piece and its containing cuboid, both shapes can be merged such that the voxels of the puzzle piece 'win'. ie the container shape will lose the voxels for the voxels in the puzzle piece with the same coords.
