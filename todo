generate all rotations
	- All rotations can be found by:
		- designate one of the face as F
		- designate the face opposite F as F'
		- start with the 6 directions F can face
		combine with the 4 rotations the cube can have. (rotations around the axis that goes through the center of F and through the center of F')	
		
	- normalized rotations: the bounding cuboid should have its 'min' point at the Origin.
	
	- check if these resulting rotational variants are really distinct


generate all translational variants within 4x4x4
  - draw the shapes in 4x4x4 area


combine 2 shapes
count overlapping blocks

Cubism features that we need;
- combine 2 shapes into 1:
  Shape.Combine(shape2);
  Better than plotting 2 shapes ontop of each other b/c it will result in rendering glitches and degrades performance.
  So to plot both a puzzle piece and its containing cuboid, both shapes can be merged such that the voxels of the puzzle piece 'win'. ie the container shape will lose the voxels for the voxels in the puzzle piece with the same coords.
